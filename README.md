# Burning-Man-Event-Search


**Event Search**
Search for events based on different criteria. The search function gives priority to different searches with the following weights:

Event Name: Highest priority.
Camp Name: Next highest priority.
Location, Description, Date/Time, and Type: These all share the lowest priority.


**Event Filter**


Filter events based on:

_Camp Name_
_Location_: If an event doesn't have a specified location, it's labeled as "Location Unspecified".

_Note_: If you select a location during filtering, the camp name options will only show camps available at that location. To view all camp name options again, press the "x" button on the location input.
